#+TITLE: CTF Infrastructure w/ Ansible

My personal home VM infrastructure for RingZer0 and similar online CTFs.

(this was originally for the team I'm part of but our tooling was too different)

* What's intended to be in the box?
- Windows RE platform
- Linux RE/solving platform
- Samba mounts between Linux RE and Windows RE systems
